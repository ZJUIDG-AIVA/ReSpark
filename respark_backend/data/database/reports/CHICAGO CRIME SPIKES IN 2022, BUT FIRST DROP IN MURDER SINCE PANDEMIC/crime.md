Despite a five-year decline in robbery and burglary, the year-over-year change showed each increased last year by 14%. Criminal sexual assault and aggravated battery still recorded declines in the past year. Murders also declined last year by 14%, despite an overall increase of 20% during the five-year period.

Chicago in 2022 recorded the fewest homicides since before the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic – between 2019 and 2020 – homicides in Chicago increased by 55%. Homicides increased again in 2021 to 804, which marked one of the deadliest years Chicago has experienced in the past quarter-century.

Despite the decrease in homicides last year, there were only three other years since 2000 in which Chicago had more homicides than it did in 2022 – and all three of those years took place recently, in 2016, 2020 and 2021.
